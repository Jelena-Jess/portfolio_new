    <p> We believe in simplicity. Whether your audience is reading content, watching a video or purchasing an item, every action should be clear throughout the website. Our goal is to create a website that highlights your company’s brand while ensuring ease of use and simplicity for your audience.</p>
    <p>The website design process starts with a sketch. First, we discuss wireframes, page layouts, and menu structures. Digital design concepts are then created. You will be presented with a variety of website design concepts to review. Feedback on the design concepts is essential to give you the opportunity to express your thoughts on the design and make alterations where desired before the final sign-off.</p>
    <p>Once the design has been finalised, the creation of the website can begin. The website development process starts by taking the graphical elements (colours, fonts, layout, images) defined in the design process and coding them using web industry standards (PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS, jQuery). This is typically done by first coding the home page, followed by templates for the interior pages. When the website is ready for review you will be supplied with login details to view the website before it is launched to the public. You will also be supplied with instructions on how to update your website.</p>
    <p>All of the websites that we create have been tailor-made and coded from scratch.</p>
