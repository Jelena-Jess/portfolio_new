      <h3 class="text-center pb-4">WordPress CMS</h3>  
      <p>WordPress CMS (Content Management System) features a user-friendly administrative area to your website allowing you to easily login and update the content of your website. You can make changes to your website's text, images or structure, without having to look at any of the programming code. You will have full control over your website’s content.</p>
      <h3 class="text-center pb-4 pt-5">Custom WordPress Themes</h3>
      <p>We create custom, tailor-made WordPress themes.</p>
      <p>Custom WordPress theme creation begins with a unique design. This process starts with a pen and paper to sketch everything from page layouts, wire-frames, sitemaps and menu structures. Digital designs are then created using the sketches, and your company’s brand guidelines are added for a personalised look and feel. Your feedback on the design concepts is essential to us as it gives you the opportunity to express your thoughts on the design and make alterations in process.</p>
      <p>Once the design has been decided on, the creation of the custom WordPress theme can begin. This starts by taking the graphical elements (colours, fonts, layout, images) defined in the design process and coding them using web industry standards (PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS, jQuery). This is typically done by first coding the home page, followed by templates for the interior pages. When the website is ready for review you will be supplied with login details to view the website before it is launched to the public.</p>
      <h3 class="text-center pb-4 pt-5">Pre-Purchased WordPress Themes</h3>
      <p>A pre-purchased WordPress theme is perfect for websites on a tight budget or deadline. It is an out-of-the-box design and layout that is ready to integrate into the WordPress CMS straight away. WordPress handles all of the content for you (posts, pages, comments etc.), while the theme transforms that content into a beautiful and clean layout for your audience to view. </p>
      <p>You will be able to make minor changes to the design to incorporate your company branding such as changing colours, adding a logo and adding imagery but if you are looking for a unique, custom design you should opt for a custom WordPress theme.</p>
      <h3 class="text-center pb-4 pt-5">WordPress Training</h3>
      <p> What is essential is that you will be supplied with comprehensive instructions on how to update your website to ensure you and your team can effectively manage your website through the WordPress administrative area. If you find some tip difficult to understand, or you run into some problem, we are happy to help you over the phone or Skype.</p>
      <p>We provide training for individuals or groups, and supply detailed notes on all of the topics covered for future reference. The training will cover everything you need to know to update your website independently, specific to your theme and custom functionality.</p>
